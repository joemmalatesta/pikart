Our senior capstone project


### Thoughts at beginning
- We have one canvas object, just the background - no inherent functionality
- The toolbar has buttons that pass a "selected" prop to the canvas to change its functionality. 
- Thats it, pretty much just 2 components with a bunch of conditionals


### Thoughts a few weeks in...
- This is way harder than I imagined lol
- Remove brush and make a clear canvas option.
- Fix text box so it doesn't interact with Canvas
- Screenshot looks like ass but what can you do...
